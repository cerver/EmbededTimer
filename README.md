Introduction
------------
EmbededTimer is a class for Generative Components that is used to code a timer with a dockable GUI that is fully GC ready. It will allow you to code in a timer very simply. The timer will update the node it is attached to at a specified interval allowing for animation effects. This node is the bases for a few other plugins from www.cerver.org but can be used for any objects that need to be animated. 

Installation and Requirements <a id="install" />
-----------------------------
This is not for use in GC, it is used only in the scripting of your own node. Look for the example feature for more info on how to implement.
